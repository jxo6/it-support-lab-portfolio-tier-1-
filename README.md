# IT Support Lab Portfolio (Tier 1)

This repository documents my hands-on troubleshooting practice across Windows, Microsoft 365, networking and hardware.  
Each folder contains real support cases written in a professional ticket-style format to demonstrate:
- Problem diagnosis
- Root cause analysis
- Resolution steps
- Customer-friendly communication
- Documentation discipline

The goal of this portfolio is to build practical IT support skills and showcase evidence of my ability to resolve technical issues independently.
